#+TITLE: Waylend Environment Settings

* ENV for Wayland

In order for some libraries to default to wayland support, it is necessary to
set some environment variables. As I tend to run different environments and
different window managers on my test system, I have isolated these into a
wayland specific file which I can source when running wayland, but not when
running X11.

#+begin_src shell :tangle wayland-env
# Force GTK to use wayland
export GDK_BACKEND=wayland
export CLUTTER_BACKEND=wayland
export BEMENU_BACKEND=wayland

# Force Qt to use wayland
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
export QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION="1"

# Java apps
export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1

#+end_src
